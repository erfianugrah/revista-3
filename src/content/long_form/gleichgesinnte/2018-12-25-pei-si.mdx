description: An old friend of ten years, how we met or got to know each other did not begin positively. It was not something that was intended however through that “coerced” relation, we learnt about one another, and especially how we, for the most part, function cognitively on the same wavelength.

An old friend of ten years, how we met or got to know each other did not begin positively. It was not something that was intended however through that “coerced” relation, we learnt about one another, and especially how we, for the most part, function cognitively on the same wavelength.

A comrade in the arts, and an idealistic thinker. A character of strength and resilience, with sheer lack of concern for how people thought of her, is something to be admired and is something that is sorely lacking in a society whereby there a predominance of the concept of “the image”, and the conscious need to fit within the social constraints of the community.
