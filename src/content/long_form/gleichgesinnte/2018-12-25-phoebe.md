Met this couple on a photo walk. The husband, an excellent illustrator with the ballpoint pen. Wife, one of the friendliest purveyors of art I have met. We sat down at a beer garden, and talked about each other and got to talking about this very project.

I went about documenting a day in the life of their family. It was a surreal experience, and oftentimes got me thinking about how distant it can be when taking photos, being a part of the ebb and flow of their day, even if just a day, proved to be something I would think about for some time.
