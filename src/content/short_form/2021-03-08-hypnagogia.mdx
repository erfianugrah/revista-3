The perception of time has changed for me, rather drastically in fact. I started seeing things a little differently, moments of wonder and awe were had even for the smallest of occurrences, which normally would have been something I just ignore. This perceived oddity led me to think about being in between states (hence the title).

I have often referred to myself in the third person, occasionally looked upon my own hands and think to myself, "Right, I do exist right now, in this moment, as a person". Taken around a place I grew up in, I wanted to evoke that sense of derealisation in this series of images.
