*"Seek freedom and become captive of your desires, seek discipline and find your liberty." - Frank Herbert*

As you have seen (or have not), I have yet again created a new page. This is more for the short term, specific-focused works that I have, compared to the more longer term yet not really long-form works that you have seen, that took months or years to have finally seen the light of day (I just love long running sentences, don't I?).

So, this is for me to improve within boundaries. Kaizen.
