It's probably just the nature of things. The more you sit on it, and dwell on it - the more you see things, newer things that you haven't seen before. 

Similar to watching a film you've watched as a child then watching it again when you're little bit older, then again when you're a little bit older. Each time, you find some new insight due to your growth as a person, and the maturation of your thoughts.

These photos I think, don't really fit a certain continuity but I feel are interesting enough - so here they are. Not sure if there'll be a Hong Kong IV, because that'll really be milking it. 

Till then.
