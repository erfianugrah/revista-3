I have been thinking of making one for quite a while (that's a recurring theme with me: waiting). And I probably should in the foreseeable future. But instead of just using the photos that I already have, maybe I'll make one for my significant other, with photos of our travels. Also, another from scratch, just starting on a project. Setting the number of images to go into it, the size of the zine and all that. That would be interesting. And I want to do it before the end of this year before I leave for my exchange.
