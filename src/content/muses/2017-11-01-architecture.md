This is something that I have always liked doing but I don't think that I have gotten any better at it. I don't know really. So, enjoy these ones, and if you're able, tell me how I can improve on the shots. These are in colour, so that's always something different from my usual black-and-white perspective of the world. I'll be running out of photos to post pretty soon. But fortunately, I have a bunch of film to shoot with soon. 9 rolls of Tri-X and 5 rolls of CineStill 800T. Really looking forward to that. Hope you are too.
