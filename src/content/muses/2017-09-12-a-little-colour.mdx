description: As you may have deduced from the title. I have started scanning my colour negatives, and I must say that it is hard. Very hard. It's tedious work getting the colour right. Then again, this is new for me. So it is a learning process. I have not yet decided whether this scanner was a good purchase or not. But time will tell. Till then, hold tight. Changes are a comin'.
