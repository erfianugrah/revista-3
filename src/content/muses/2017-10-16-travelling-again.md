In about three months I will leave the country to the cold, cold Scandinavian lands. Well. Just Sweden, but I will make sure to do some fair bit of travelling, and of course lots of photo taking business. If you're asking (which I'm sure you're not) why I am going to Sweden again, well, as you know (or do you), I'm a university student, so I'm going there on exchange with the added bonus of being with my significant other again. So yes. Most of the administrative nonsense are taken care of. And with money, you can do anything. Sad fact of life. Well, without you can too. Just exponentially harder.
