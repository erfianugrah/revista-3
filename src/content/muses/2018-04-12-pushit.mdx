If you are privy to the title, then great. If not, it is a song by Tool is a bit about breaking negative patterns, in standard Tool fashion, with sex allegories. I recommend you give it a listen, well, also the other Tool songs.

This is also to notify you, my dear readers (*however small that number may be*) that I have added web push notifications to the website (*haha yes, now you know why I chose the title among other things*), you will get a notification to allow *notifications*, and that is all, not much there is to it. Not to worry, you will not be spammed. I do not post updates that often but I feel this public service announcement is necessary in case you thought it was spam or something like that. The website is encrypted and protected using Cloudflare so it is safe as it can be, without paying, and being on the internet that is.

And if you are wondering how my work is going, well, I have to say, not as well as I hoped it would be. But I have some film negatives ready to be developed. I hope soon, I will start shooting more. Get everything developed and publish it all at once as a complete wholesome body of work. Doing a long form project is definitely a different beast of its own. Especially in this day and age of instant gratification, instantaneous access to information and set weekly schedules of endorphin intake from your favourite social media outlet.

It is good to slow down and take it in, sometimes.

I get it. I like to do things fast, I like to finish something before moving on if not it will nag at me for the rest of the day, week, month or year until the thing that I have to do, gets done.

Then, comes the aspect of having to do something with lofty expectations or ideals which I have always found myself setting. It is unrealistic, yes. It is probably, definitely, mentally and physically unhealthy. But it pushes me. Definitely not very sustainable, so I have to strike a little balance there, and figure out a mental system in which I can function to the best of my ability and skill.

Well, that became a rant, again. But hey, I do not feel good about posting a short one. I expect my readers to have a little more attention span.
