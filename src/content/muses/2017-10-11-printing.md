I have been doing a lot of darkroom printing lately, and posting photos from my Hong Kong trip a year ago. But for the most part I have a dearth of content to post I think, so that has to change if I can say so myself. Being in university certainly does not make that easier, and I am sick. Again. It's probably the same thing which came back. I didn't really give myself time to recover fully too, so there's that. I tend to think I can do anything when I can't. Getting old now. 

Anyways, I digress. But what is there to digress from anyway, and who reads this shit?
