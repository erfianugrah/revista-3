Didn't really think that this would be a thing, but apparently it has now. I'm writing again. I think there's cause for celebration.

Maybe not.

Today I was in the darkroom for the first time. For someone who has shot on film for 6 years, and never being in the darkroom, is a bit of a shame. Regardless, I will strive to develop my own film, at the very least, the black and whites ones my own. Of course, I'm scanning them by myself as well. Speaking of which, the film scanner is called Reflecta RPS 10M, expensive as hell and it's on its way here.

Hope to god nothing screws up. That'll be a $900 screw up if it does. Plus shipping.
