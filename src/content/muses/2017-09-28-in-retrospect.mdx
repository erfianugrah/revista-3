description: Shooting on colour was not too shabby. However, I should have developed the film negatives as soon as possible. A lot of the colour might have "run out", "faded off" maybe. I'm not too sure. I don't think Kodak Portra 400 should look like that even pushed to 1600. I took a whole year to finally develop and scan them. So a lot of tinkering had to be done just to get the colour that I want but even then it might not be up to the level that I want it to be.

Shooting on colour was not too shabby. However, I should have developed the film negatives as soon as possible. A lot of the colour might have "run out", "faded off" maybe. I'm not too sure. I don't think Kodak Portra 400 should look like that even pushed to 1600. I took a whole year to finally develop and scan them. So a lot of tinkering had to be done just to get the colour that I want but even then it might not be up to the level that I want it to be.

That's not to say that I know how to edit colour. I don't, really. This was a learning process for me. A rather daunting one. Took me quite a lot of guesswork and rare moments of epiphany to get something decent out of them and even then maybe not so much. Regardless, I have 5 rolls of CineStill 800T to shoot in the near future so I'm excited to see what kind of results I would be able to achieve
