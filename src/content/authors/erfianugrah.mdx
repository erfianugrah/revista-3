## About me

> <small>If you want a rather cute-sy explanation of the inner machinations of my mind (yes I quoted that from Patrick Star), read [What is Erfi?](https://www.erfianugrah.com/zeitweilig/what-is-erfi/) by Lena.</small>

We can start by breaking it down according to attributes - primarily personality attributes, in which case, I'm usually pissed at something one way or another. My entire identity revolves around that fact. My wanting to fix them, be it inanimate objects, or even humans.
