Modus operandi; anything goes. I’ve often thought about expectations, definitions or categorisations when it comes to the "ideal" persona that I would like to interact with, and I get that it helps with finding what you are looking for.

However, I find myself always falling short when it comes to this. Mostly because it is not exactly possible to find the kind of writing you like, therefore personality and physicality when it comes to it.

There's the ideal self that you express, as well as the ideal persona that you desire. And we usually end up with interests or more accurately shared narratives, in the hopes of being even a little bit accepted, or fitted in. Are we in a way lying to ourselves by doing so? I think not. We exist unlimited within a limited spectrum of being. Every side of the die, are just the many facets of the self, each one equally true.

We human beings are genetically social creatures. We strive to find common ground, a sense of belonging (one might say), with someone else. It opens up the two parties to talk about what they are both familiar with, therefore a chance for friendship or more. 

We can try to remove the expectations, remove the definitions, categorisations, stereotypes, labelling and what not (taxonomy). And just fall free. What you would call, a leap of faith. However, this too, is very difficult and counter intuitive, it's almost impossible to get rid of all notion of preconceptions or judgments. As that would be akin to achieving Buddha-hood of sorts.

I would say to take it upon yourself to adopt a certain naiveté in your thinking and that you could be pleasantly surprised with what you’ll get. However, that's also something I cannot promise myself.

What I can promise is that I will try my best.

I am but a student of life. Still young, albeit age is no factor for wisdom. So bear with the ignorance if I do display them. I’m open to all and everything (this is really up to you interpret). There is no discrimination here. But again, suffice to say, the fallibility of being human still plays a part here.

Lastly, I appreciate effort and sincerity, and most of all; curiosity.
